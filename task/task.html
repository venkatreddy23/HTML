    <h1>HTML INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <P>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the core language used to structure content on the web. It organizes text, images, links, and media using tags and elements that browsers can interpret. As of 2025, over 95% of websites rely on HTML alongside CSS and JavaScript, making it a fundamental tool in modern web development.</P>
    <ul>
        <li>It is a markup language, not a programming language. This means it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.</li>

        <li>It is a static language, meaning it does not inherently provide interactive features but can be combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In a nutshell, HTML is all about organizing and displaying information on a webpage. We can think of it as the bones or structure of a webpage.</p>
    <h3>Basic HTML Code</h3>

    <h2>HTML page structure</h2>
    <p></p>
    <img src="structure.png" alt="">
    <ul>
        <li><a href="">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</a></li>
        <li><a href="">&lt;html&gt;</a></li>
        <li><a href="">&lt;head&gt;</a></li>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>&lt;title&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;meta&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;link&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;style&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;script&gt;</li>
        </ul><pre>
<li><a href="">&lt;title&gt;</a><p> The title is what is displayed on the top of your browser when you visit a website and contains the title of the webpage that you are viewing.</p></li><li><a href="">&lt;h2&gt;</a><p>The h2 tag is a second-level heading tag.</p></li><li><a href="">&lt;p&gt;</a><p>The p tag represents a paragraph of text.</p></li></pre>
    </ul>
    <p>An HTML document can be created using an HTML text editor. Save the text file using the ".html" or ".htm" extension. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.</p><br>
<p>Note: Basic/built-in text editors are Notepad (Windows) and TextEdit (MacOS). Other advanced text editors include Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, etc.</p>
<h2>HTML Elements and HTML Tag</h2>
<p>HTML Elements and HTML Tags are related but distinct. An HTML element is the complete structure, including the opening tag, content (if any), and the closing tag (if applicable).
<br>
On the other hand, A tag is the actual keyword or name enclosed in angle brackets (< >) that tells the browser what kind of content to expect.</p>

    <tr>
        <td><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/html-tutorial/">&lt;html&gt;</a></td>

    </tr>

<h2>HTML Attributes</h2>
    <p>Attributes provide additional information about an element. They are placed inside the opening tag and are written as name="value". Common attributes include class, id, href, and src.</p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <p>&lt;a href="https://www.example.com/">Visit Example a&gt;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>href is an attribute of the <a> tag that defines the URL of the link.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Web Browser</h3>
    <p>Unlike other programming languages, HTML does not show output on the any compiler. Web browsers is an compiler which show the results of an your HTML code.

It reads HTML files and determines how to show content with the help of HTML tags. Any web browser (Google, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc) can be used to open a . HTML file and view the results.</p>
