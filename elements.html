    <h3>
        <u>1.What is a Programming language?</u>
    </h3>
    <p>A programming language is a formal <b>system of instructions</b> used to communicate with a
computer.</p>
<p><mark>Enables developers to write programs for various tasks</mark>  such as web development, data
analysis, and automation</p>
    <h3><u>2.Why Python?</u></h3>
    <p>Ease of Use: <i>
        Simple syntax, ideal for beginners
    </i></p>
    <p> <em>Versatility: Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural,
functional).</em>
    </p>
    <p><del>Extensive Libraries: Rich ecosystem for tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and web
development.</del></p>
        <p><strong><u>3.What is Python?</u></strong></p>
        <p><mark>Python is a high-level</mark> interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and
readability</p>
            <p><em>Python emphasizes code readability and supports multiple programming paradigms, including
<b>object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.</b>
</em></p>
    <u><h3>4.Where Python is Used?</h3></u>
    <p><del>1.Web Development: Frameworks: Django, Flask.</del></p>
    <p><mark>2. Data Science and Machine Learning: Predictive modeling and data analysis using NumPy,
Pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn.</mark></p>
        <h3><button>5.Companies using Python:</button> </h3><em>Google, Netflix, Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox, NASA, Uber, Reddit, IBM,
10000 coders dashboard</em>
            <h4><i>6.Some disadvantages of Python:</i></h4>
            <Strong>1. Slower Execution Speed
○ Interpreted language, making it slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java.
○ Not ideal for performance-critical applications (e.g., real-time systems, gaming
engines).<br>
2. Memory Consumption
○ Python’s dynamic typing and garbage collection can lead to higher memory usage.
○ Not suitable for applications where memory optimization is crucial.<br>
3. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
○ The GIL restricts the execution of multiple threads at the same time.
○ This makes Python less efficient for multithreaded applications, especially on multi-core
processors.<br>
</Strong>
<h6>7.Python Installation:</h6>
<small>1. Download link: Download Python | Python.org<br>
2. Commands to check installations:
a. In cmd: python --version</small>
<h4><i><u>8.Different Modes of Working</u></i></h4>
<mark>: Python provides various modes to write and execute code, each suited
for different workflows and purposes.
1. Interactive Mode: Python code is executed directly in the Python shell or terminal.
a. In cmd: type py or python to enter into the python shell.
i. exit() to come out of the python shell.
b. Search idle in the window's search to directly enter the python shell</mark><br>
<strong><u>9.Script Mode:</u></strong>
a. Write Python programs in a .py file and execute them as a whole.
b. Run using the command: python filename.py.
<h3><em><u>10.Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</u>:</em></h3>
<p><strong>a. Use tools like PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code for an enhanced coding
experience.<br>
b. Offers features like debugging, syntax highlighting, and autocompletion</strong></p>
